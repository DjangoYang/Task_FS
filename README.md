Task_FS

Use the available data from a file to save it in a database
 in real time based
on the difference of the timestamps in the file. This should act like a publisher where the the
published data based on the timestamp should automatically update the database with all
the entries.
## Installation

`npm install react-api-data`

or

`yarn add react-api-data`

Make sure _fetch_ is available globally, polyfill it if needed to support older environments.

## Install dependencies

React-api-data requires the installation of the peer-dependencies react-redux, redux-thunk and normalizr. 
These can be installed with the following command:

`npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk normalizr`

or

`yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk normalizr`


## how all this can be implemented on AWS. What all
services will be used from the available list of services by AWS

using AWS ec2 to deploy backend and rds for database
